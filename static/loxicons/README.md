# README

The original App icons are part of the LoxConfig program and can be found in the following directory:

```
C:\ProgramData\Loxone\Loxone Config <version>\IconLibrary.zip
```

Alternatively, you can find the icon libary on your Miniserver, by connecting via FTP (login required)

```
/sys/IconLibrary.zip
```

Unzip the IconLibrary into the directory `static/loxicons`. After unzipping the icons are available in `static/IconsFilled/` and will be used in LoxBuddy App.

*NOTE: Future version of the App will automatically download the icons*
